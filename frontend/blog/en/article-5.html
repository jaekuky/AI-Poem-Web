        <article class="article-content">
            <p>There are moments in life when we need to express our feelings in words. Whether it's a wedding speech
                for a friend, a thank you note for a parent's 70th birthday, or an anniversary letter to a loved one.
                However, when we finally pick up the pen, our minds often go blank. In such times, AI & Poem becomes a
                reliable ally.</p>

            <h2>1. Wedding Speech: Adding Wit to Sincerity</h2>
            <p>A speech that is too stiff or too light can be problematic. Try asking the AI, "A wedding speech for my
                best friend, touching yet humorous." By adding a spoonful of memories with your friend (e.g., "the
                nights we stayed up studying for exams together"), you can create the perfect speech.</p>

            <h2>2. Love Letter: Between Cheesy and Romantic</h2>
            <p>Instead of just repeating "I love you," try borrowing poetic expressions. Instead of the common phrase
                "You are my world," the AI can suggest something like "You are the only starlight that fills my
                universe." As long as you take the time to write the generated poem by hand, it will be enough to
                capture your partner's heart.</p>

            <h2>3. Thank You Note: With Graceful Sentences</h2>
            <p>On Teacher's Day or Parents' Day, there are times when you want to express your gratitude but can't find
                the right words. Try generating a poem that conveys "respect and gratitude." A message with refined
                language and rhythm will resonate deeply with the recipient.</p>

            <h2>Usage Tip: Use the Reading Function</h2>
            <p>Once you've finished writing, use the 'Read Aloud' feature of AI & Poem to listen to it beforehand. You
                can check if there are any awkward parts when read aloud and if the emotions are conveyed well.
                Recording yourself reading it and sending the audio file can also be a special gift.</p>
