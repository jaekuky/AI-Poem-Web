        <article class="article-content">
            <p>Just as AlphaGo shook the world of Go, generative AI has entered the realms of art and literature. There
                are reports of poems written by AI winning literary contests. Many ask, "Will AI replace human writers?"
            </p>

            <h2>AI as a Tool</h2>
            <p>When the camera was invented, painters feared losing their jobs. However, photography became a new art
                form, and painting found a new path in abstraction. The same is true for AI poetry generators. They do
                not replace writers; rather, they are powerful tools that expand a writer's imagination.</p>
            <p>Writers can quickly create dozens of drafts using AI and select gem-like ideas from them. When
                experiencing the pain of writer's block, AI can serve as an excellent pace-maker.</p>

            <h2>The Human Domain: Unique Experiences and Soul</h2>
            <p>AI learns from vast amounts of data to create 'the most plausible' sentences. However, AI lacks 'life.'
                It does not have direct experiences such as the sorrow of losing a loved one, the excitement of first
                love, or the frustration of failure. The reason human poetry moves us is that it embodies the poet's
                life and soul.</p>
            <p>Readers respond to the author's anguish and sincerity that lie beyond the text. No matter how
                sophisticated the sentences generated by AI are, it is difficult to completely replace the unique
                narratives of humans.</p>

            <h2>A Collaborative Future</h2>
            <p>The literature of the future will not be 'human vs AI' but 'human with AI.' A new creative process where
                humans add flesh to the bones generated by AI and breathe soul into them will become commonplace. AI &
                Poem is a space where we can experience that future in advance. We look forward to a new era of
                literature born from the meeting of technology and emotion.</p>
