            <p>Recently, with the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the realm of creation has expanded to include art, music, and literature. Services like 'AI & Poem' can generate poetry on any topic the user desires in just a few seconds. So, how can the cold machine of AI mimic the 'emotion' that was once considered the exclusive domain of humans?</p>

            <h2>The Magic of Large Language Models (LLMs)</h2>
            <p>At the core of AI's ability to write poetry is the **Large Language Model (LLM)**. Models like GPT have been trained on billions of sentences and text data. In this process, AI learns not just to memorize words, but to understand the probabilistic relationships between words, context, and nuance.</p>
            <p>For example, it statistically understands that words like "flower," "warmth," and "sprout" are likely to follow the word "spring." However, poetry is not just a game of probabilities; it requires metaphor and symbolism.</p>

            <h2>Pattern Recognition and Creativity</h2>
            <p>AI identifies poetic patterns within the learned data. By analyzing tens of thousands of poems, it learns structures such as rhyme, rhythm, and poetic license. When a user presents the theme of "the sorrow of parting," AI connects emotional vocabulary related to that theme and rearranges sentences according to the learned poetic structure.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Association:</strong> It associates words like 'rain,' 'sea,' and 'cloudiness' with the word 'tear.'</li>
                <li><strong>Structuring:</strong> It adopts forms like the narrative structure or a four-line poem.</li>
                <li><strong>Style Imitation:</strong> If requested to mimic a specific poet's style, it emulates their characteristics (e.g., use of archaic language, short breaths).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Limitations and Possibilities of AI Poetry</h2>
            <p>Of course, AI does not actually feel 'sorrow' or 'joy.' It is the result of meticulous calculations. However, if that result moves the reader, can we not call it art? AI can present unique combinations of words that human writers may not have considered, becoming a wonderful tool that breaks through the barriers of creativity.</p>
            <p>AI & Poem utilizes this technology to provide an experience where anyone can become a poet. Discover what beautiful poetry your small idea can create when it meets AI—experience it right now.</p>
