            <p>How did great poets leave behind immortal works? While their talent is important, behind it lies intense contemplation and unique creative habits. Today, we peek into the techniques of beloved Korean poets and seek hints that we can apply to our own creations.</p>

            <h2>Yun Dong-ju: Constant Self-Reflection</h2>
            <p>The most notable feature of poet Yun Dong-ju, famous for 'Foreword' and 'Night of Counting Stars', is the 'aesthetics of shame'. He constantly gazed into his own inner self as if looking into a mirror. His verses may not be flamboyant, but they resonate with readers through sincere confessions.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When writing poetry, look deep into your most honest emotions, even those feelings you might be ashamed to show others. Authenticity is the most powerful weapon.</p>

            <h2>Kim So-wol: Inheriting Folk Rhythm</h2>
            <p>Kim So-wol, the poet of 'Azalea', modernly inherited the rhythm of traditional Korean folk songs, specifically the 7-5 meter. The catchy rhythm, as in "If you find me disgusting / When you leave / I will quietly send you off," is why his poems are sung like songs.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Try writing poems that are pleasant to read aloud. By consciously placing words with rhythms like 3-beat or 4-beat, the flavor of the poem comes alive.</p>

            <h2>Lee Sang: Breakthrough and Experimentation</h2>
            <p>Lee Sang, the poet of 'Ogamdo', conducted groundbreaking experiments such as ignoring spacing, using numbers, and geometric arrangements. By breaking existing grammar, he expressed the anxious inner self and the alienation of modern individuals.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't be bound by form. Sometimes breaking grammar or combining unfamiliar words can create new meanings. How about asking AI to "write in a surrealist style"?</p>

            <p>Each poet had their own methods, but they all wrote with intense contemplation. AI & Poem is a tool that alleviates your struggles. Realize the tips learned from the masters together with AI.</p>
