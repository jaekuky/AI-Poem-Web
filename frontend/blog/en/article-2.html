            <p>Writing poetry is about painting the landscapes of your heart with words. It can sometimes feel overwhelming, but if you remember a few principles, anyone can write great poetry. Whether you use AI tools or pick up a pen yourself, here are 5 tips to elevate your poetry.</p>

            <h2>1. Observe Specifically</h2>
            <p>Instead of writing "a beautiful flower," try writing "a red rose kissed by the morning dew." Specific nouns and verbs create vivid images in the reader's mind, rather than abstract adjectives. When inputting a topic into AI, describing specific situations can yield better results.</p>

            <h2>2. Make the Familiar Strange (Metaphor and Symbolism)</h2>
            <p>Look at everyday objects from a new perspective. Instead of saying "time flows," express it as "time slips through my fingers like grains of sand." When you make the familiar strange, poetic tension arises.</p>

            <h2>3. Emphasize Rhythm</h2>
            <p>Poetry is a genre that is read with the eyes and heard with the ears. The rhythm that flows smoothly when read aloud is important. Adjust the length of sentences or repeat similar sounds to create a sense of rhythm. Utilizing the 'recital' feature of AI & Poem to check the rhythm of generated poetry is also a great method.</p>

            <h2>4. Capture Honest Emotions</h2>
            <p>Raw sincerity resonates more deeply than elaborate embellishments. Be honest about your sadness or joy. When you infuse your experiences and emotions, readers will truly empathize.</p>

            <h2>5. Revision is Essential</h2>
            <p>You can't be full after the first bite. Hemingway said, "All first drafts are garbage." Instead of using the poem generated by AI as is, change words and rearrange them to refine your work. The more you go through the revision process, the more your poem will shine like a gem.</p>

            <p>Open AI & Poem right now and apply these tips. A wonderful poem filled with your unique sensibility is waiting for you.</p>
