        <h1>Kebijakan Privasi</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: March 24, 2025</p>

        <p>AI &amp; Poem ("Service", "we", "us") provides an AI poetry generation tool available at https://www.ai-and-poem.art/. This Kebijakan Privasi explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use the Service. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to this Policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect only the minimum data needed to operate the Service and comply with Google AdSense policies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Topic you submit:</strong> Text you provide as the poem topic is processed solely to generate the poem you requested and is not stored after we send the response.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Our hosting provider and analytics tools may automatically log IP addresses, browser types, device information, timestamps, and similar data for security, diagnostics, and statistical purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> We use essential cookies to maintain core site functions. Google AdSense and Google Analytics may set cookies to deliver, personalize, and measure ads and to analyze traffic in line with their respective policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the Service.</li>
            <li>Generate AI poems in response to user requests.</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Use.</li>
            <li>Support advertising and analytics that align with Google AdSense program policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Advertising and Analytics Partners</h2>
        <p>We partner with Google AdSense to deliver advertising. Google may collect or receive information from your browser or device through cookies and similar technologies and use it for ad measurement and personalization. Learn more at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>.</p>

        <p>We also use Google Analytics to understand usage patterns. Analytics data is aggregated and pseudonymized to help us improve the Service.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We do not retain poem topics or generated poems beyond the time needed to fulfill your request. Server logs and analytics reports are kept only as long as necessary for security, troubleshooting, and compliance, after which they are pseudonymized or aggregated.</p>

        <h2>5. Sharing Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell or rent personal information. We may share limited data with trusted service providers (such as hosting, analytics, and advertising partners) who support Service operations. These partners must protect the data and use it only for the purposes we specify in our agreements.</p>

        <h2>6. International Transfers</h2>
        <p>Because the Service relies on global cloud and CDN infrastructure, data may be processed or stored in multiple regions. When you access the Service from outside those regions, local privacy laws may differ. We apply reasonable technical and administrative measures, consistent with legal and contractual requirements, to keep data secure.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You may choose not to enter a poem topic, but in that case we cannot generate a poem.</li>
            <li>You can block cookies in your browser settings, though doing so may limit features such as ad personalization.</li>
            <li>If you reside in a region with specific privacy rights (e.g., the EU or California), you may contact us to request access to or deletion of personal data we hold. Because we do not store input text, our ability to locate specific records is limited.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Personalized ads choices:</strong> You can opt out of personalized ads in Google <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ads Settings</a>. Some third-party networks also honor opt-outs submitted at <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAI/youradchoices</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Notice to EEA/UK/CH users:</strong> We use a Google-certified CMP integrated with the IAB TCF to collect, store, and transmit consent for cookies and device identifiers. You can revisit "Cookie Settings (Manage Consent)" at the bottom of the page to reset or withdraw your choices at any time.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

        <h2>9. Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information, but no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Policy to reflect operational practices, legal requirements, or Service improvements. We will post the revised Policy with a new effective date, and we may provide additional notice of material changes.</p>

        <h2>11. Contact</h2>
