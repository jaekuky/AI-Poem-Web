        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective date: March 24, 2025</p>

        <p>AI &amp; Poem ("the Service", "we", "our", or "us") provides an AI-powered poetry generation tool accessible at https://www.ai-and-poem.art/. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you agree to the terms described below.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We aim to collect only the minimum data required to operate the Service and comply with Google AdSense policies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-provided topics:</strong> The text you submit as a poem topic is processed to generate the requested poem. We do not persist these inputs after the response is returned.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Our hosting provider and analytics tools may automatically log IP address, browser type, device information, and timestamps for security, diagnostics, and aggregated usage reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> We use essential cookies to maintain basic site functionality. Google AdSense and Google Analytics may set cookies to deliver, personalize, and measure ads and to analyze traffic. These providers may collect data in accordance with their own policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the Service.</li>
            <li>To generate AI poems in response to your requests.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
            <li>To support advertising and analytics in line with Google AdSense Program Policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Advertising and Analytics Partners</h2>
        <p>We partner with Google AdSense to display advertisements. Google may collect or receive information from your browser or device using cookies or similar technologies and use that information to provide ad measurement and personalization. You can learn more about Google’s data usage and how to control it at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>.</p>

        <p>We also use Google Analytics to understand aggregated usage patterns. Analytics data is anonymized and used to improve the Service.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We do not store poem topics or generated poems beyond the duration required to serve your request. Server logs and analytics reports are retained only as long as necessary for security, troubleshooting, and compliance, after which they are deleted or anonymized.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell or rent personal information. We may share limited data with trusted service providers (such as hosting, analytics, or advertising partners) that assist us in operating the Service. These partners are bound by contractual obligations to protect your data and to use it only for the purposes specified by us.</p>

        <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>The Service is hosted in the Republic of Korea with backups in other regions as needed. If you access the Service from outside these locations, you consent to transferring your information to these jurisdictions, which may have different data protection laws than your country.</p>

        <h2>7. User Rights and Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You may decline to submit poem topics; however, the Service requires a topic to generate a poem.</li>
            <li>You can adjust your browser settings to block cookies. Disabling cookies may affect certain features, including ad personalization.</li>
            <li>If you are located in a jurisdiction with specific privacy rights (such as the EU or California), you may contact us to request access to or deletion of any personal data we maintain about you. Because we do not store poem inputs, our ability to locate specific data may be limited.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Service is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

        <h2>9. Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or service enhancements. We will post the updated policy with a new effective date. Material changes may also be communicated through an on-site notice.</p>
